# Astros
 Game developed in Python using pygame framework
 
 ## Project Description
The game revolves around a space expedition in a spacecraft.

The expedition encounters several challenges like comets, asteroids that needs to be shot down and black holes that needs to be avoided to preserve life and to gain points.

The spacecraft also encounters boosters.

- Power-Ups:
  - Frost Ball:
        Freezes the approaching hurdles
  - Energizer:
        Recuperates the spacecraft

- Hurdles:
  - Black Hole:
        Cannot be obliterated
        Interaction with it completely damages the spacecraft
  - Large Asteroid:
        Reduces health of spacecraft by three levels
  - Small Asteroid / Comet-I / Comet-II
        Can be destroyed with a single bullet
        Causes a single level damage to the spacecraft


As the expeditionary force gains points, they enter into higher levels (up to level 4) with increasing difficulty.
